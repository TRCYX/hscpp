# hscpp
Some basic Haskell ideas in C++

Implements basic concepts such as Functor, Foldable and Monad.

hscpp does not simulate Haskell features perfectly because C++ templates do not work the same way as Haskell. This project is basically for fun, and for exploiting capabilities of the C++ language.

See [src/hs.cpp](src/hs.cpp) for an example.

*Heavily uses template magic, may crash compilers.*
